# Streams Operators

## Reduce
More specifically, reduction stream operations allow us to produce one single result from a sequence of elements, by repeatedly applying a combining operation to the elements in the sequence.

## Stream
One of the major new features in Java 8 is the introduction of the stream functionality – java.util.stream – which contains classes for processing sequences of elements.

## Interface Default and Static Methods
Before Java 8, interfaces could have only public abstract methods. It was not possible to add new functionality to the existing interface without forcing all implementing classes to create an implementation of the new methods, nor was it possible to create interface methods with an implementation.

Starting with Java 8, interfaces can have static and default methods that, despite being declared in an interface, have a defined behavior.
