## Reduce
More specifically, reduction stream operations allow us to produce one single result from a sequence of elements, by repeatedly applying a combining operation to the elements in the sequence.

## Stream
One of the major new features in Java 8 is the introduction of the stream functionality – java.util.stream – which contains classes for processing sequences of elements.
