/**
 * Before Java 8, parallelization was complex. The emergence of the ExecutorService and the ForkJoin
 * simplified a developerâ€™s life a little bit, but it was still worth remembering how to create a
 * specific executor, how to run it, and so on. Java 8 introduced a way of accomplishing parallelism
 * in a functional style.
 *
 * The API allows us to create parallel streams, which perform operations in a parallel mode. When the source of a
 * stream is a Collection or an array, it can be achieved with the help of the parallelStream() method
